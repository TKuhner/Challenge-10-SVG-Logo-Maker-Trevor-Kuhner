# SVG Logo Generator

This is a simple SVG logo generator script that allows you to create a logo by choosing a shape, its color, and adding text with a specified color. The generated logo is saved as an SVG file and can be opened in a web browser to view the logo.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v12 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

   ```shell
   npm install inquirer svg.js

3. Initialize the package by running the following command in the project directory:

   ```shell
   npm i

## Usage

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

    Run the script by executing the following command:

    shell

    node index.js

    Follow the prompts to provide the required information for your logo:
        Enter the text for the logo (maximum 3 characters).
        Specify the text color.
        Choose a shape for the logo (square, triangle, or circle).
        Specify the color for the chosen shape.

    After providing the necessary information, the script will generate an SVG file named logo.svg in the project directory.
